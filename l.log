Spring 2012 HW1 Sample Solution
Prepared by Jonathan Hsiao

For HW2, you can build on your HW1 submission, or you may also use this sample
HW1 solution to build on. In either case, replace this README with your own.

In this sample solution, util.c and util.h contain the following functions:

+ Two linked list types, target_t and linked_list. The only major difference is
  that target_t has additional space for two additional pointers to linked
  lists, for the list of dependencies and the list of commands for each target.
+ Linked list functions to add and search, one for each of the two types.
  Unlike the linked list in recitation, the functions take a pointer to the
  first element of the list, and new additions are appended to the end of the
  list, in order to make sure entries are retrieved in the same order they were
  added (FIFO). This is useful for things like keeping the list of commands in
  the order they were listed in the Maumfile. In addition, the search function
  returns the node found (or NULL if not found), and the add function returns a
  pointer to the list.
+ The makeargv and freemakeargv functions from recitation 2 (originally from
  p.37 of the textbook).
